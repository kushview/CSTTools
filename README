This directory contains programs from the CST in Paris, France. 

/**********
toXYZ: this program takes an 8 bit or 16 bit RGB tiff file and transforms it into
the X'Y'Z' 12 bit color space. It takes a gamma value if the input file is not in a 2.6
gamma space. However the output file will be at 1/2.6 gamma. 

There are 3 matrices that may be chosen from: the identity matrix, which can be used to see
the error introduced by the log->linear->log conversions, the SMPTE DC28.30 (2006-02-24)
matrix definition, and the StEM matrix definition. I found when I first wrote this program
that when using the SMPTE matrix on the StEM material that the conversion was not exactly
right. After looking around a bit I found on the following web page
(http://www.cinematography.net/4KDemoOfFilmDigitalCinema.htm) a matrix that was used to
produce the StEM material. Indeed, when this matrix is used, there is very little difference
between the processed image and the reference StEM image.

I used a LUT as using the power function on each component of each pixel is very expensive.
The use of the LUT speeds up the process by 10 times (depending on the precision). (10s->
1s/image). If you want to try the power function you  can use the -p switch.

/**********
tiffdiff: this program takes two input tiff files of the same size and outputs an absolute 
difference image. 

/**********
tiffhist: This program will output the histogram of an 8 or 16 bit tiff file to stdout. 


/**********
Dependencies: 
	You will need a libtiff library. This version compiles on libtiff-3.6.1 and
libtiff-3.8.2. 

Compiling:
	modify the Makefile for location of tiff include files
	make
